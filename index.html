   <h1>Have You Ever Thought About Gender?</h1>
<!--
Tutorial 
The chart is comprised of 3 axis. 

One is for boy or masculine however you’d like to define it 
Another is for girl or feminine energy
The 3rd is 3 or other or you can label it whatever you would like when submitting your chart. 

B for boy or masculine energy, G for girl or femmininine energy and 3 or other. An axis you can leave as is (3/Other) or you can name yourself

The circles represent percentages. The center is 0%, the first circle is 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

You can feel as much or as little gender as you wish. It doesn’t need to add up to 100.

         <h2>An Interactive Zine </h2>
         <p>
         A collaborative experiment in visual self-expression, created by trans people. Users can create gender charts that reflect how they understand and feel their gender, and add to a growing collection of gender charts.
         <br>
         Goals <ul>
         <li>Celebrate trans creativity by giving people tools to visually express their gender outside of language.
         </li><li>
          Build a living archive of gender charts.
         </li><li>
          Explore the nuances of labels by analyzing the similarities and differences between people with the same identities and their intersections.
         </li>
         </ul>
